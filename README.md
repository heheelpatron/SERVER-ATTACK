# SERVER-ATTACK
---

Creating a server network and adding PCS, laptops and other wireless devices. Try to attack the network through SQL injection or MITM 

The main reason for this project is to create good network environment that any hacker can't go through it.

The resources that I'll need are a computer that will be used as a DHCP, HTTPS and DNS server to create a domain and every device form the network have an ip and a website.
Another 2 computers to create the attack with any iso ideally any distribution of linux. 

Me and my partner have been working on this project lately, we are using an free vpn server called tailscale so we can put every machines in a network without beeing present with each other,
in each computer we installed virtual machines because we lack devices.
**soon will be updates**
